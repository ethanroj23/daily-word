Alone
not good that the man should be alone, Gen. 2:18 (Moses 3:18; Abr. 5:14).
not able to perform it thyself alone, Ex. 18:18.
not able to bear all this people alone, Num. 11:14 (Deut. 1:9).
Man shall not live by bread alone, Matt. 4:4 (Luke 4:4).
tell him his fault between thee and him alone, Matt. 18:15.
