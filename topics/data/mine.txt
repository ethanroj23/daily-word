Mine
severed you from other people, that ye should be mine, Lev. 20:26.
they shall be mine, saith the Lord, Mal. 3:17 (3 Ne. 24:17).
all mine are thine, and thine are mine, John 17:10.
Titus, mine own son after the common faith, Titus 1:4.
riches of eternity are mine to give, D&C 67:2.
they shall be mine in that day when I shall come, D&C 101:3.
