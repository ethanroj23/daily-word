Yesterday
thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, Ps. 90:4.
Christ the same yesterday, and to day, Heb. 13:8 (1 Ne. 10:18; 2 Ne. 2:4; 27:23; Alma 31:17; Morm. 9:9; Moro. 10:19; D&C 20:12; 35:1).
I, the Lord, was angry with you yesterday, but today mine anger is turned away, D&C 61:20.
