Message
Ehud said, I have a message from God, Judg. 3:20.
He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool, Prov. 26:6.
citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, Luke 19:14.
this is the message that ye heard, 1 Jn. 3:11.
therefore I finish my message, Mosiah 13:7.
saying he has a message from God, offer him your hand, D&C 129:4.
he will still deliver his message, D&C 129:7.
